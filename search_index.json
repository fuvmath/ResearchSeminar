In this course, mathematics faculty will first take turns presenting research problems in their respective fields of expertise. The goal is to expose students to different lines of research in mathematics so that interested students may choose a potential topic to explore for Senior Capstone. After the faculty’s presentations, students will present assigned readings. The goal of this part is to help students learn how to synthesize and convey ideas of other peoples’ work. Along the way, students will learn how to apply learned mathematical concepts to understand complex research topics.
