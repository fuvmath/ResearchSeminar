This is a research seminar aimed at students who wish to major in mathematics.
In this course, mathematics faculty will first take turns presenting research problems in
their respective fields of expertise. The goal is to expose students
to different lines of research in mathematics so that interested students may
choose a potential topic to explore for Senior Capstone.
After the faculty's presentations, each student will choose a topic that was introduced by a
faculty and present assigned readings.
The goal of this part is to help students learn how to synthesize and convey ideas
of other peoples' work. Along the way, students will learn how to apply learned
mathematical concepts to understand complex research topics.

Some materials require time to be accustomed to. Some students are quicker than
others. However, on average, you should expect 10-15 hours per week (including class time)
on the materials in order to know the subject relatively well.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Collaboration \& Plagiarism}

Plagiarism is the act of submitting the intellectual property of another person as your own. It is one of the most serious of academic offenses. Acts of plagiarism include, but are not limited to:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Copying, or allowing someone to copy, all or a part of another person's work and presenting it as your own, or not giving proper credit.
\item
  Purchasing a paper from someone (or a website) and presenting it as your own work.
\item
  Re-submitting your work from another course to fulfill a requirement in another course.
\end{itemize}
